    <p>
        Docker is a container platform that allows you to build, test and deploy applications quickly.
    </p>
    <h3>
        what is docker ?
    </h3>

    <p>
        A developer defines all the applications and it’s dependencies in a Dockerfile
        <br> which is then used to build Docker images that defines a Docker container.
        <br> Doing this ensures that your application will run in any environment
    </p>
    <h3>
        Why docker ?
    </h3>
    <p>

        Using Docker lets you ship code faster, standardize application operations, seamlessly move code, and save money
        by improving resource utilization.
        <br> With Docker, you get a single object that can reliably run anywhere.
        <br> Docker's simple and straightforward syntax gives you full control.
        <br> Wide adoption means there's a robust ecosystem of tools and off-the-shelf applications that are ready to
        use with Docker.
    <P>
    <section>
        in my point of view docker is more poweful than any virtual machines because it easy to use and also don't need
        high configuration pc <br>
        this is all happen due to docker container provide by docker hub .

    <h3>
        What can I use Docker for?
    </h3>

    <p>
        Fast, consistent delivery of your applications <br>
        <br>
        Docker streamlines the development lifecycle by allowing developers to work in standardized environments using
        local containers which provide your applications and services. <br>
        Containers are great for continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) workflows. <br>

        Consider the following example scenario: <br>

        <br>
        Your developers write code locally and share their work with their colleagues using Docker containers. <br>
        They use Docker to push their applications into a test environment and execute automated and manual tests. <br>
        When developers find bugs, they can fix them in the development environment and redeploy them to the test
        environment for testing and validation. <br>
        When testing is complete, getting the fix to the customer is as simple as pushing the updated image to the
        production environment. <br>
        <br>
        Responsive deployment and scaling <br>

        Docker’s container-based platform allows for highly portable workloads. Docker containers can run on a
        developer’s local laptop, on physical or virtual machines in a data center, on cloud providers, or in a mixture
        of environments. <br>

        Docker’s portability and lightweight nature also make it easy to dynamically manage workloads, scaling up or
        tearing down applications and services as business needs dictate, in near real time. <br>

        Running more workloads on the same hardware <br>

        Docker is lightweight and fast. It provides a viable, cost-effective alternative to hypervisor-based virtual
        machines, so you can use more of your compute capacity to achieve your business goals. <br>
        Docker is perfect for high density environments and for small and medium deployments where you need to do more
        with fewer resources. <br>
